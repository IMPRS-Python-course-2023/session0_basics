# Exercise 5
# Ask for a 'password' and ensure that it is at least 8 characters long;
#  use a while-loop to keep asking until the password is long enough.
# Then ask for the user to type the password again, and check that it
#  is the same; while it is not the same, keep asking again.
# Take a look at your solution to password.py to get started!
