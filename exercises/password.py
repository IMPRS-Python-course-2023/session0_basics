# Exercise 1
# Ask for a 'password' and ensure that it is at least 8 characters long,
#  using the len() function.
# Then ask for the user to type the password again, and check that it
#  is the same. 
# Print output indicating whether the password is long enough and
#  whether it was repeated correctly.
